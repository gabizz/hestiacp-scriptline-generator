HestiaCP is a fork of VestaCP, a bold and smart open smart initiative to offer a lightweight replacement to webserver commercial admin panels

 My humble contribution to this project is a tiny online vanilla javascript app able to generate the necessary scriptline for an unatended HestiaCP installation

 You may access it here  https://gabizz.github.io/hestiacp-scriptline-generator/

 Feel free to use it, improve it or integrate it
